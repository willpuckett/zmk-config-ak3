# ZMK firmware for Apple Keyboard II.

![AKIII](static/akiii.png)

For most mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, the Apple Keyboard II is probably one of the most hated products ever made. It's rubber dome switches are known for their mushy-ness. It's a nostalgic keyboard for me though, and I wanted to bring some attention to it and modernize it a little bit.

As I worked into this project, it seemed to make sense to build a new pcb that could connect to the flat cable from the original keyboard membrane.

This repo houses the firmware for the project. You can find it under [releases](https://github.com/willpuckett/zmk-config-ak3/releases/latest). 

The pcb is [available on OSH lab](https://oshwlab.com/willpuckett/akiii).
